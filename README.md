Building AI course project

This is a course project for the “Elements of AI” course, intended to present my own idea for utilizing AI.

## Summary
This project introduces an “Ethical AI” checklist: a simple AI‑assisted tool that helps organizations reflect on ethical and other strictly non‑technical aspects of an AI project. The purpose of the checklist is to help ensure that an AI project is ethically acceptable.

1	“Ethical AI” Checklist
Building AI course project
This is a course project for the “Elements of AI” course, intended to present my own idea for utilizing AI.

2	Summary
This project introduces an “Ethical AI” checklist: a simple AI assisted tool that helps organizations reflect on ethical and other strictly non technical aspects of an AI project. The purpose of the checklist is to help ensure that an AI project is ethically acceptable.

3	Background
Artificial intelligence is increasingly used to support decision making in both public and private organizations. At the same time, ethical questions such as transparency, fairness, privacy, and accountability are often handled only superficially.
In many organizations, AI ethics principles and everyday project work do not clearly connect. This can lead to situations where ethical risks remain unnoticed, compliance requirements are misunderstood, and, as a result, trust in AI based solutions is weakened.
My motivation for this project is to design a checklist supported by AI that helps organizations reflect on ethical and other non technical questions.

4	How is it used?
The Ethical AI Checklist is intended to be used in the early phases of an AI project, such as idea development, procurement, or pilot planning.
The user, for example a project manager or subject matter expert, describes the planned AI system in basic terms:
•	what the system is meant to do
•	what kind of data it uses
•	in what context decisions or recommendations are made.
Based on this description, the checklist presents structured ethical questions and highlights areas that may require closer attention. The tool does not provide final answers or approvals. Instead, it is meant to support human judgment and encourage discussion and documentation.

5	Data sources and AI methods
The project does not rely on personal data.
The checklist is built around predefined ethical themes such as transparency, fairness, accountability, and data protection. These are combined with simple rule based logic and natural language processing. AI is used mainly to support a conversational interface and structured reflection.
This “Ethical AI” checklist is a support tool for ethical reflection, not an automated evaluator.

6	Challenges
The Ethical AI Checklist does not automatically resolve ethical questions.
Responsibility for ethical decisions remains with the people using the tool, and its usefulness depends on how accurately the project is described. In addition, the checklist cannot replace legal review, ethics committees, or formal compliance processes.
There is also a risk that the checklist could become a superficial “tick box exercise” instead of a genuine reflection tool. This risk should be recognized from the beginning.

7	What next?
At this stage, the idea remains conceptual. It could be developed further by adapting the checklist to specific domains, such as public administration or healthcare, or by linking it more closely to regulatory frameworks. It might also be used to generate documentation that supports AI governance and decision making processes.
Developing the idea into a practical tool would require collaboration between AI developers, domain experts, and specialists in ethics and regulation.

This project is inspired by public discussions on responsible AI, existing AI ethics guidelines, and the Elements of AI course by the University of Helsinki and Reaktor.
